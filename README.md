# Decision Tree
Performing a Decision Tree classifier on the '[Diabetes.csv](https://github.com/fardinabbasi/Decision_Tree/blob/main/Diabetes.csv)' dataset to distinguish between diabetes and non-diabetes cases.

The dataset is divided into a **training set** and a **test set** during the **preprocessing** step.
The scikit-learn **built-in function** is utilized for implementing the Decision Tree classifier.
```ruby
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
```
